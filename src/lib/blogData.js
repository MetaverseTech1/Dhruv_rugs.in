          In the world of interior design, luxury is not just about grandeur — it's about authenticity, craftsmanship, and timeless elegance. Few décor elements capture this spirit as beautifully as a hand-knotted rug. Every knot, fiber, and motif represents countless hours of artistry, turning raw materials into a masterpiece that can transform any room into a statement of taste and refinement.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-6">The Soul of Craftsmanship</h2>
        <p class="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
          A hand-knotted rug isn't merely produced; it is created. Skilled artisans, often carrying generations of inherited knowledge, tie thousands — sometimes millions — of knots individually on a vertical loom. Each knot contributes to the overall design, forming intricate patterns that no machine can truly replicate. Depending on the size and complexity, one rug can take six months to two years to complete. These rugs aren't just décor items; they're cultural artifacts — preserving regional techniques from Persia, India, Turkey, and beyond.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-6">Luxury Through Natural Materials</h2>
        <p class="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
          Luxury lies not only in design but in the materials used. The finest hand-knotted rugs are crafted from premium wool, silk, and bamboo silk, ensuring each creation embodies purity and perfection. Wool offers soft resilience and natural luster, while silk provides radiant sheen and smooth texture for elegant spaces. Bamboo silk serves as a sustainable, eco-friendly alternative with silky softness.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-6">The Designer's Secret Weapon</h2>
        <p class="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
          A hand-knotted rug anchors a room, sets the tone, and elevates the design narrative. Whether your décor leans minimalist or regal, these masterpieces adapt beautifully. Interior designers value the ability to customize colorways, patterns, and sizes for each project, creating truly bespoke pieces that transform spaces from penthouses to boutique hotels.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-6">Sustainability and Timeless Beauty</h2>
        <p class="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
          Hand-knotted rugs are inherently sustainable — made from natural fibers using manual processes that support artisan communities with fair wages and ethical production. This is the essence of slow luxury: appreciating artistry, time, and tradition in an age of fast fashion. With proper care, these rugs last generations, aging gracefully while retaining their charm and value, becoming treasured heirlooms that tell stories of living history.
